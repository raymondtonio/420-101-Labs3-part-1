It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.

1. :

2. 

3. 

4. private Instructor tutor;

5. - Each time the increment method is called, the value of the Number Display is raised by one.
   - As you keep calling the increment method, the value resets to 0 when reached to the same number as the rollover limit.

6. call the increment method on the hours object to increase the hour by 1

7. display.getValue()
    returned int 0
display.increment();

8. only the first call to setValue changed the result of the stored value because the limit was set to 6 in NumberDisplay call

9. - i predict that it'll be 0 because the value you set should always be under the limit not equal or higher.
   
10. Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context

11. Error: '.class' expected
    the correct way is this : display.setValue(5);

13. 0

14. as it becomes an if or else situation. any negative replacement value would now be able to set or else non negatives as long as they are greater than or equal to.

15. - ! false
    - (34 != 33) && ! false
    
16. (a && b)

17. (a && b!) || (a! && b)

18. No, it is 0 

19. yes, you need to recreate or type again the code of your NumberDisplay object since it erases the previous ones that existed before the change.

20. predict: - 11cat
             - cat11
   - it rather confuses me than surprise due to why it shows error when that code is typed.
